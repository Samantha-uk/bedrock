# Description
Bedrock is a Docker based, backend server for Home Assistant; supporting zigzag.

# Why Bedrook?
Well, Bedrock implies a foundation or solid basis to build something.
Bedrock uses Deno as a core element ... Deno ... Dino, OK, it's corny but it will allow a number of Flintstone based names.
